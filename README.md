# SearchBook

A simple project using the public API from Google Books.

In this project it's possible  to make simple querys of books from google API through
an input field.

The results pops up simultaneously as you type in the input field with the follow data:

- Book cover;
- Book title;
- Author name;
- Published date;

This project was made with pure javascript, html and css. Also, the animation used in the UI was downloaded from LottieFiles.

The goal with this project is practicing the call API with Fetch method in javascript.
